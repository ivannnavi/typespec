        honest with yourself how could you ever hope to communicate something meaningful to someone else? Design is all about fucking relationships—the relationship of form and content, the relationship of elements, the relationship of designer and user.
        What’s important is the fucking drive to see a project through no matter what. If you fucking give up, you will achieve nothing. Don’t get hung up on things that don’t fucking work. Learn from fucking criticism. Widows and orphans are terrible
        fucking tragedies, both in real life and definitely in typography. Fuck. Paul Rand once said, “The public is more familiar with bad fucking design than good design. </p>
